### Open Government, Source Developer at Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada ###

I'm currently working on new [Solr based search application](https://github.com/thriuin/oc_search) for [Canada's Open Government Portal](https://open.canada.ca).
Currently I'm learning more and more about [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and how to make more use of all its capabilities to make the Government of Canada's site even more accessible. I'm looking to collaborate on a custom python [Solr client library](https://github.com/thriuin/SolrClient) that I'm using to create Solr applications.
